Data Mining Project for the Zillow Kaggle Competition
Special thanks to Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1 for the opportunity to both learn and apply more data mining skills.
Credits/links to public kernels used to benchmark our scores can be found in the report.
All codes were run with Python 3.6. 
As stated in the report, we had to redesign the competition training and testing set as the submission deadline was over
test.csv, train.csv and new_submission.csv are the files we used for testing, training and submitting data respectively
In addition, the new algorithm to derive the average MAE score as described in the report is found in the models' files themselves.
An example can be found in Score calculator (LightGBM benchmark).ipynb
